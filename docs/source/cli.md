# Kernels CLI Reference

## Main Functions

### kernels check

You can use `kernels check` to test compliance of a kernel on the Hub.
This currently checks that the kernel:

- Supports the currently-required Python ABI version.
- Works on supported operating system versions.

For example:

```bash
$ kernels check kernels-community/flash-attn3
Checking variant: torch28-cxx11-cu128-aarch64-linux
  üêç Python ABI 3.9 compatible
  üêß manylinux_2_28 compatible
[...]
```

### kernels to-wheel

We strongly recommend downloading kernels from the Hub using the `kernels`
package, since this comes with large [benefits](index.md) over using Python
wheels. That said, some projects may require deployment of kernels as
wheels. The `kernels` utility provides a simple solution to this. You can
convert any Hub kernel into a set of wheels with the `to-wheel` command:

```bash
$ kernels to-wheel drbh/img2grey 1.1.2

### kernels upload

Use `kernels upload <dir_containing_build> --repo_id="hub-username/kernel"` to upload
your kernel builds to the Hub. To know the supported arguments run: `kernels upload -h`.

**Notes**:

- This will take care of creating a repository on the Hub with the `repo_id` provided.
- If a repo with the `repo_id` already exists and if it contains a `build` with the build variant
  being uploaded, it will attempt to delete the files existing under it.
- Make sure to be authenticated (run `hf auth login` if not) to be able to perform uploads to the Hub.
